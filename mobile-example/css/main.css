/* Note: This demonstrates how multiple stylesheets can be combined
   into one stylesheet to be linked in HTML files.

   There are pros and cons to this method. It allows a designer to
   keep files organized by the content of the stylesheet. However,
   this method requires mutliple requests from a server and may
   slow down loading time.

   The latter issue is really beyond the scope of this course. If
   such a method were utilized, chances are there are engineers who
   can optimize a server to make the process faster.

   But I figured this was worth introducing since it reinforces the
   idea of keeping structure and presentation separate.
