    <!-- The viewport can best be described as the physical screen size
         on a device. In the case of an iPhone 4, 320px x 480px.

         We set the width to device-width. Some other devices recognize
         this as well.

         Initial scale tells us to display the content at a 1:1 scale.
         Without this, the iPhone will show a 'zoomed out' version as
         if it were 980px wide - - that's what mobile Safari /thinks/
         the typical size of a web page is.

          <p>This site is designed for both the web and mobile devices.

          <p>To view the mobile version of this site, open Chrome Developer tools. Click the mobile icon (<img src="img/mobile.png" alt="mobile" class="mobile"/>) next to "Elements." In the menu above, set the Device to "Apple iPhone 5" &mdash; this will adjust the viewport dimensions.</p>

          <p>If you uncheck "Fit" it will keep the mobile constraints, but give you a bigger viewing area to examine the page.</p>

          <p>You may need to refresh the page to view the mobile version.</p>

          <p>Note the differences between the two.</p>
