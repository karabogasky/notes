        <h2>Six Stages</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Site definition &amp; planning</li>
          <li>Information architecture</li>
          <li>Site design</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Why a process?</h2>

        <p>The deeper one gets into the construction process, mistakes and changes become more costly and time consuming.</p>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Site definition &amp; planning</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>define your objectives</li>
          <li>collect, analyze information you need to build the site</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Document your plans</h2>

        <p>Don't go off memory. A written document becomes your 'blueprint' as you get deeper into each iteration. It helps you from forgetting a detail.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Information architecture</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>inventory your content</li>
          <li>define the structure of your site
            <ul>
              <li>develop a site map</li>
              <li>sketch wireframes</li>
              <li>take measurements into account</li>
              <li>solicit early feedback from potential users</li>
              <li>establish a style guide (colors, fonts, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>develop mockups or functional prototypes</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Functional Prototypes</h2>

        <p>Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign mockups only account for static design.</p>

        <p>Functional prototypes account for interactivity.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Think Small</h2>

        <p>A functional prototype can be very detailed, but think of it as a way to test small aspects of your site. Build small examples of how you expect your site to 'respond.'</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Think Small: Navigation</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>What is the default state?</li>
          <li>What is the hover/focus state?</li>
          <li>What happens when a user activates a link?</li>
          <li>What response does interaction elicit?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Site Design</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>make sure all content is acquired, edited and proofread</li>
          <li>graphical elements are sized based on wireframe specs</li>
          <li>repeating design elements are are consistent (i.e. header, nav, footer)</li>
          <li>behavioral specifications are defined</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Everything should be polished.</strong></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Site Construction</h2>

        <p>Focus on:

        <ol>
          <li>Structure</li>
          <li>Presentation</li>
          <li>Interactivity</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If your site warrants it, develop a template.</p>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Create a template</h2>

        <p>You may find that as you design your pages, a pattern will develop. Elements you should expect to be the same across pages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>header</li>
          <li>navigation</li>
          <li>containing element (maybe)</li>
          <li>footer</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Tip:</em> Build one page with each of these elements <em>100 percent polished</em>, then just copy the template!</p>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Testing</h2>

        <p>As you finish each aspect of your site (structure, presentation), be sure to test your code.

        <p>Run your code through a validator. Make sure any tweaks you make are also valid.</p>

        <p>Does the site appear as you expect it to?</p>

        <p>Does the site function as expected?</p>

        <p>When all tests check out, that's when you can deploy your site.</p>
