        <h2>Software</h2>

        <p>Operating information used by a computer. These consist of instructions dictated by code.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>operating system</li>
          <li>applications</li>
          <li>scripts</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Input &amp; Output</h2>

        <p>Information provided to a computer which is then processed is <strong>input</strong>.</p>

        <p>The results generated by a computer after it processes information is <strong>output</strong>.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Binary</h2>

        <p>The most basic 'language' a computer understands.</p>

        <p>All instructions given to a computer are converted to ones (1) and zeros (0) which represent on-and-off electrical states which make computer processors work.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Types of Information</h2>

        <p>For a computer to be valuable, we must give it information to process. There are four types of data computers work with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>numeric</li>
          <li>character-based</li>
          <li>audio / visual</li>
          <li>instructional</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Numeric Information</h2>

        <p>A sequence of binary can represent numbers in decimal (base 10), the numeric system we use daily.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>No.</th>
              <th>Binary</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>001</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>010</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>011</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>100</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>101</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Converting binary to decimal provides us with numbers for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>mathematical calculations</li>
          <li>a foundation for representing other information familiar to humans</li>
        </ul>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Numeric Systems</h2>

        <p>Because we can convert binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10), we can also convert these binary sequences to:

        <ul>
          <li>octal (base 8)</li>
          <li>hexidecimal (base 16)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Octal and hexidecimal were frequently used by mainframe programmers due to memory limitations.</p>

        <p>It is not common to see either numeric system in use today, but they still exist in some areas of computing.</p>

        <h2>Character-Based Information</h2>

        <p>Text is the form of communication which allows us to exchange information with a computer.</p>

        <p>We work with a <em>character set</em>, which maps the letterforms of a language and combinations of keystrokes to a binary sequence.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2><abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</h2>

        <p>The standard character set used by computers is known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>128 characters -- letters, numbers, punctuation</li>
          <li>binary ranges from 0000000 to 1111111</li>
          <li>includes 'control' characters</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In ASCII, 1110111 1100101 1100010 represents the word "web".</p>

        <h2>Instructing Computers</h2>

        <p>When we give computers instructions through commands or programs, our sequence of human-readable characters become <em>strings</em>.</p>

        <p>Combinations of these strings form <em>instructions</em>.</p>

        <p>These compound instructions become <em>programs</em>.</p>

        <p>The syntax (words, punctuation) we use to write programs represents a <em>language</em>.</p>
