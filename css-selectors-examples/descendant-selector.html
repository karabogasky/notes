    <section>

      <p>In this example, we have changed the font family Helvetica (with Arial or a generic sans-serif font as a backup). The base font size is set at 16 pixels. The font color is a dark gray.</p>

      <p>We have adjusted the font size of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to 32 pixels.</p>

    <section>
      <p>We have also created two sections in this document. These are marked up by <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.</p>

      <p>We applied a declaration saying any <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag which is a descendant of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> should be orange.</p>

      <p>Note that it does not matter <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> is also nested within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.</p>
