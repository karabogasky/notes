    <h1>Universal Selector</h1>

    <p>In this example, we have changed the font family Helvetica (with Arial or a generic sans-serif font as a backup). The font size is set at 16 pixels. The font color is a dark gray.</p>

    <p>Notice the font size for <code>h1</code> and <code>p</code> is the same.</p>

    <p>We have also marked up <code>code</code> in this document, but instead of its monospace default font, it has changed to the font family specified above.</p>
