###How to download your notes

You will need to have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed on your computer.

1. Click the 'Clone in Desktop' button in this GitHub repository (repo):

   <img src="img/github-clone.png" width="358" height="72"/>

   If you receive an alert which asks you to launch GitHub Desktop, click 'Launch Application.'

2. When prompted to save the repo, click 'Clone'. Be sure to note the directory in which you are saving the files on your computer.


###How to update your notes

If you 'watch' this repo on GitHub, every time there is a change, a notice will appear on your main page feed. When this happens:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.

2. Select the notes repository in the left column.

3. Click 'Sync' in the top, right corner.

###How to review your notes

I write all of the class notes using HTML (and CSS). This is to help become familiar with looking at code, in addition to learning the content. (Again, the more you see and do, the more comfortable you become.)

There are two ways you can review the notes.

1. View the **text and code** used to create the .html documents.

   Open one of the files in your text editor (i.e. Atom, Brackets, etc.). You can do this by right-clicking on the notes repo in GitHub Desktop and select 'Open in Atom.' If you are using another text editor, select 'Open in Finder' instead, then drag and drop the files onto your text editor's icon (or open the files through the text editor).  

2. View the notes as they are formatted for the web. Open one of the files in your web browser (File > Open File).

   I don't expect you to understand what is going on with the code just yet. This is a way for you to see how the code works, and maybe even play with the code. Tinker with it!


###FAQ

**What if I play with the code and break it?**

That's okay! Do it! Play! Break! You can always get a fresh copy. To do so, open GitHub Desktop and select the repo in the left column. Next click the tab which displays the text 'uncommitted changes.' This will reveal a list of files which have been changed. Select the files you want to restore. Then select 'Repository > Discard Changes to Selected Files...' This will restore the file to its original version.

**What's this I hear about 'git-ing' extra credit?**

I make mistakes. Code errors. Typos. Professors = 100 percent human.

If you find an error in any of the code repos (they have to be `.html` or `.css` files), make the correction and submit a pull request on GitHub.

Each accepted pull request is worth one point toward your final grade. (In the case of multiple submissions, the first student with the correct fix will earn the point.)

The faster you learn git and GitHub, the sooner you may earn points.

The catch? There are about 30 students taking Web Design this semester, and you share the same notes repo. If you find an error, move fast! (And don't tell anyone else!)
